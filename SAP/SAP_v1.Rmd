# Hypothesis

Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients' recommended
course of treatments are identified in National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) guideline. The guideline suggests each patient to perform
biopsy to identify presence of targetable mutations of certain
biomarkers and PDL1 expression to make a informed decision on 1L therapy
choice. This recommendation is made because targeted therapy is better
for patient's survival than a standard, genetic therapy such as
chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Usually, at least 1 positive mutation or
2 negative mutation status among all targetable biomarkers should be
obtained to make informed decision about targetable therapy. Thus having
at least 1 positive mutation or 2 negative mutation status will be
referred to as *useful* mutation test result from here onward.
Similarly, obtaining PDL1 expression level (from 0-100%) level, as
opposed to result such as missing expression level or indeterminate
result, will be referred to as *useful* PDL1 test result.

The standard NCCN guideline, however, may not always be followed due to
reasons such as clinician's expert knowledge and ethics. For example,
heavy smokers who develop lung cancer is most likely due to smoking
rather than genetic mutation. Patients who fall into this category then
may receive chemotherapy right away, instead of performing and waiting
for genetic or PDL1 test results. One reason for not waiting until the
useful test comes out is that a complete panel of test results (combined
mutation and PDL1 expression tests) usually takes about 2-3 weeks to
become available. It may take longer if the biopsy samples were not good
and the test results are indeterminate, requiring another round of
biopsy and waiting for the result. This period of waiting without doing
any treatment may be detrimental to patient's health and thus becomes an
ethical issue. Therefore, the ultimate choice of whether waiting for the
test result or not relies heavily on the clinician's decision.

Just like the example of heavy smokers, there are some patient
characteristics that are highly indicative of patient's likelihood of
targetable mutation status. However, there has not yet been a
quantitative evaluation of effect of proceeding to 1L therapy prior to
knowing targetable mutation status in patients. In this study, we
evaluate causal effect of proceeding right 1L therapy in all aNSCLC
patients, as well as in some subgroups that have previously been
identified as associated with the mutation status.

\

# Objectives

**Primary Objective**: Using marginal structural model, we will develop
and evaluate the effect of proceeding to 1L therapy prior to obtaining
useful targetable mutation status

-   Limit the number of weeks.
-   For entire observation.

**Secondary Objective**: Test impact of proceeding to 1L before useful
tests become available in the following subgroups: male, female, have
history of smoking, do not have history of smoking, baseline Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 0-2, baseline ECOG score 3-4,
baseline albumin \< 35g/L, baseline albumin \>= 35 g/L, and Asian.

-   These are the subgroups identified by Wally as having either higher
    or lower probability of having targetable mutation, and thus would
    more or less likely wait for the useful test results to become
    available prior to initiating 1L therapy.

# Study Design and Population

## Study Design

Retrospective Cohort Study

## Study Population

**Data**: A nationwide Flatiron Health electronic health record
(EHR)-derived de-identified database. The Flatiron Health database is a
longitudinal database, comprising de-identified patient-level structured
and unstructured data, curated via technology-enabled abstraction
[@ma2020comparison; @birnbaum2020model]. The de-identified data
originated from 280 cancer clinics (\~800 sites of care). Patients with
a BirthYear of 1937 or earlier may have an adjusted BirthYear in
Flatiron datasets due to patient de-identification requirements. For
more information, please refer to their webpage [@zhang2025].

**Inclusion criteria**: People who got diagnosed with aNSLC (ICD-9 162.x
or ICD-10 C34x or C39.9) from 01 January 2011, to 30 December 2022 from
Flatiron Health network.

1.  Index date is date of aNSCLC diagnosis.

**Exclusion criteria**:

1.  Initiate who receive first-line (1L) therapy on or after the index
    date.
2.  Receive any useful test result (either PDL1 or targetable mutation)
    prior to the index date
3.  Missing death or censoring date

Patient attrition diagram is shown below. It shows all exclusion
criteria. We excluded all patients who don't have valid survival end
time and who start either the 1L therapy or valid test before advanced
diagnosis date. We will explain what valid test means in the next
section.

# Data Strucutre

There are 9 data sets of wide and long formats. Data sets containing
repeated measurements such as visits, PDL1 or targetable mutation test,
or lab values will be long format. The unit of observation differs by
the dataset.

1.  Create a single date variable where useful PDL1 test results are
    observed in each patient.
2.  Create a single date variable where useful targetable mutation test
    results are observed in each patient.
3.  For each consecutive week after the index date, create a binary
    indicator variable indicating who initiated 1L therapy before
    receiving any useful test is out. (Cohort identification)
4.  Create baseline covariates as listed in \@ref(sec-appA)

<!-- -->

a.  report the percent missing of each variable overall by exposure
    group as in \@ref(tab:baseline-missing-mock)

<!-- -->

5.  For each consecutive week after the index date, a long dataset is
    created for each patient's weekly time-varying follow-up variables
    listed in Appendix B. There will be a variable named $k$ which shows
    number of weeks since index date. When $k=0$, it refers to baseline.
    Suppose for an example, albumin measurement at $k=1$ represent
    measurements taken between $(0,7]$ days, and at $k=2$ will represent
    measurements taken between $(7,14]$ days.\
6.  Impute censoring date using visit and oral medication record

# Cohort

## Directed acyclic graph (DAG)

```{r fig-DAG, out.width='70%',  fig.cap="Figure XX: Directed acyclic graph. Y refers to survival outcome, A's refer to time-dependent cohort status, L's refer to time-dependent measured confounders, and U's refer to time-dependent unmeasured confounders. Index 0 is the baseline measruement. Thus, L0 contains variable such as gender and race/ethnicity. L1 then has a subset of variables of L0, where only time-varying variables are contained. The time index (k) goes from 1 through K_i, where i refers to a patient. Each patient has different number of weeks of follow-up until censored or dead."}

knitr::include_graphics("./image/DAG.jpg")

```

\@ref{fig-DAG}

We define time-varying cohort variable at each $k$ for a patient as
follows. For simplicity, we will drop $i$ in $K_i$ without loss of
generality. :

-   $k =\{1,2,..., K\}$, number of weeks from time zero, where $K$ is
    week when death/censoring occurs.
-   Define earliest valid test result date as the date when any one of
    1) PDL1 expression level, 2)1 positive mutation, or 3) 2 negative
    mutations was made available to the clinician.
-   $C_k = min \{\text{end of week $k$, earliest valid test result date} \}$
-   $A_k =\begin{cases} 1, & \text{if } A_{k-1}=1 \text{ or if 1L therapy is initiated before }C_k \\  0, & \text{if } A_{k-1} \neq 1 \text{ and if 1L therapy is not initiated before } C_k \end{cases}$

In a plane language, we have two cohorts for each time interval $k$. One
cohort is the patient who has $A_k=0$, where 1L was

\

# Outcome

Death.

If date of death is missing, the patient was presumed alive and was
censored at the most recent record of valid vitals or oral medication
dates as advised [@RN408].

Date of death is provided only up to month, for de-identification
purposes. As we required up to days for survival analysis, we imputed
date of death at the 15th of the month of death as recommended by
Flatiron Health. This approach best approximates the results generated
from using the exact date of death in comparative analysis pre and post
de-dentification[@RN261].

\

# Covariates

## Baseline (45 variables)

List of baseline covariates and their definitions are listed in
\@ref{sec-appA}. Note that most recent measurement prior to index date
will be used.

1.  Socio-demographics (5): gender, age, Race/Ethnicity, Smoking status,
    histology
2.  ECOG (1): Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score
3.  Vitals/Labs (39): body mass index (BMI), Continuous and categorical
    version of complete metabolic panel (CMP) and complete blood panel
    (CBP) collected by Flatiron. Except carbon dioxide and glucose from
    complete metabolic panel has been excluded due to volatility over
    every seconds.

-   CMP ($12 * 2$): Albumin, Alkaline, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
    Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Bilirubin, Calcium, Chloride,
    Creatinine, Potassium, Protein, Sodium, eGFR
-   CBP ($7 * 2$) : Hematocrit (HCT), Hemoglobin (HGB), Lymphocyte
    count, Neutrophil count, Platelet, Erythrocytes (RBC), Leukocytes
    (WBC)

\

## Time-varying (40 variables)

ECOG PS (ECOG) reflect the patient's overall health. The higher the
score, the severe the health of the patient. Clinicians use ECOG to
decide whether they should wait until valid test can be obtains prior to
administering 1L or not. Therefore, ECOG is both a risk factor for
mortality and also predicts subsequent exposure. Morevoer, waiting/not
waiting for valid test results prior to 1L initiation can also affect
the ECOG score. We decided to use all vitals/labs and ECOG scores to be
time-varying. Since this is the first study of its kind, we decided to
do a variable selection to identify such confounder. ECOG and albumin
are the two time-varying covariates that are chosen by the oncologist
that he uses himself to make the decision. All other values will be
explored for their role as time-varying confounders using variable
selection method.

All time-varying covariates are updated for each time interval (weekly).
If there are more than one observation in the interval, then the first
one observed will be chosen. If no observations are made in the
interval, the last observed value will be carried forward indefinitely
until a new measurement is available or until the patient dies or is
censored. These covariates will be used to generate inverse probability
of weighting.

\

# Statistical analysis

1.  To account for missingness of baseline covariates (quantified in
    Table 1), for the ones we think are missing at random (MAR), perform
    multiple imputation with chained equations in 10 imputed
    datasets[@white2011multiple].
    i.  Weights (below) will be re-computed separately within each
        imputed data set.
    ii. Effect size and standard error estimates will be computed using
        Rubin’s formula across the imputed data sets.
    iii. Due to computation burden, we will nest the bootstrapping
         procedure for calculating confidence intervals within each
         imputed dataset, instead of the other way around.
2.  For the covariates that are missing not at random (MNAR), create a
    categorical variable that includes missing as one level.
3. Generate propensity score of initiating 1L therapy before observing valid test results using a logistic regression model as a function of all baseline covariates (Table 2)

## Valid targetable mutation test or PDL1 test

The point of conducting this analysis is whether proceeding to provide
1L therapy before knowledge of PDL1 expression level or targetable
mutation status would impact the survival. Thus, valid PDL1 test refers
to test results with non-missing PDL1 expression level in the dataset.
[PDL1 expression levels indicate patient's susceptibility to
immumotherapy, with higher percentage indicating immunotherapy will work
well on the patient.]{style="color:red;"}

On the other hand for the targetable mutation, we have 8 different
biomarkers for which we can test for mutation. They are: ALK, EGFR,
BRAF, KRAS, MET, RET, ROS1, and NTRK. Clinicians typically find it
useful to have at least 1 positive mutation or 2 negative mutations to
make informed 1L therapy decision. Thus, any patient who have either 1
positive mutation or 2 negative mutation results are considered to have
valid targetable mutation result. We identified a biomarker to be
mutation positive if it had any one of the following entries in
"BiomarkerStatus" column. :

-   Mutation positive

-   PD-L1 positive

-   Rearrangement present

-   Rearrangement positive

-   Amplification positive

-   Protein expression positive

-   PD-L1 positive

Similarly, we identified a biomarker to be mutation negative if it had
any one of the following entries in the same column. :

-   Mutation negative

-   Negative

-   PD-L1 negative/not detected

-   Rearrangement not present

## Cohort

In our analysis, we assess impact of proceeding to 1L therapy without
either valid PDL result or targetable mutation result. Here, we identify
two cohorts. First cohort is those who proceeded to 1L therapy before
either valid PDL1 or targetable mutation result were observed. Second
cohort is those who received 1L therapy after observing either valid
PDL1 or targetable mutation result. Therefore, cohort is a function of
time from time zero until either valid PDL1 or targetable mutation
result date and 1L therapy start date.

That is, if a patient has a record of 1L before either valid PDL1 or
targetable mutation result, then the patient is identified as a
